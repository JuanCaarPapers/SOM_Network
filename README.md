Autoassociative Map Generator with SOM Networks
================================

<h2>Project Description</h2>
The tool will allow adjusting parameters at runtime and the process will be documented with comments and detailed explanations of the code used. To achieve this goal, the L1P1-SOM_colores.ipynb notebook will be used as a base and a SOM network will be implemented using comments and specific cells to explain the algorithms and code used.
